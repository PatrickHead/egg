embryo
======

embryo is a generic parser generator that uses the Expression Grammar, Grammer
(EGG) grammar format for input.  This parser is intended to be able to parse,
verify and generate a grammar parser framework from any grammar defined in EGG.

The resultant parser design uses many of the concepts developed and documented
in tutorial form by Jack W. Crenshaw PHD.  embryo produces pure recursive
descent parsers.

Other code modules are also added to provide utility functionality, such as a
separate grammar framework generation function library, an input source
function library, an input location tracking mechanism, and a callback
mechanism for parsers that need to work "on-the-fly" such as interpreters.
