embryo

embryo is a generic Expression Grammar, Grammer (EGG) parser.  This
parser is intended to be able to parse, verify and generate a grammar
parser framework from any grammar defined in EGG.

The parser design uses many of the concepts developed and documented
in tutorial form by Jack W. Crenshaw PHD.  embryo is a pure recursive
descent parser.

Other code modules are also added to provide utility functionality,
such as a separate grammar framework generation function library.
